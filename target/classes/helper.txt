Use ping to Check Server Reachability:
     ping srv469.hstgr.io
Use this command to run the programn: 
     mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.fppproject.MigrationRunner"

📌 My Setup So Far:
✅ DB created on Hostinger
✅ Flyway created the person table via V1__create_person_table.sql
✅ I have MigrationRunner.java to apply migrations
✅ Everything is working cleanly with db.properties


Use Flyway SQL files to:
Create tables and indexes
Insert static or seed data (like sample users, default roles)
Modify schema across project versions (e.g., adding columns)

Use JDBC code when your app needs to:
Insert data based on user input
Query rows and display to user
Update or delete a record from the UI or API

🔹 Think of It Like This:
Flyway = "Set up the kitchen" (install shelves, drawers, appliances)

JDBC = "Cook a meal" (put food in, take food out, clean the dishes)

You don’t remodel the kitchen every time you want to eat — you use it.
